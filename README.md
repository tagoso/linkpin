## Acknowledgments

My deepest gratitude goes to [@kristoferlund](https://github.com/kristoferlund) for maintaining the following NPM packages. These libraries were indispensable in bringing Linkpin to life!

- **[`ic-use-internet-identity`](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-use-internet-identity)**: This package offers a seamless and intuitive way to integrate Internet Identity (II) authentication into React applications. Without it, Linkpin's smooth login functionality wouldn't have been possible.

- **[`ic-use-actor`](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-use-actor)**: Simplifies managing actors on the Internet Computer, making interactions with canisters straightforward and maintainable.
